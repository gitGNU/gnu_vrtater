INSTALL file for vrtater.
Copyright (C) 2013 J. A. Green <green8@sdf-eu.org>
license: GNU GPL v3, see COPYING, otherwise see vrtater.c

Basic installation from source tarball or snapshot.

If you can already compile glx programs installation should be pretty easy.

example: (replacing the 1.0 with the version or snapshot id you have)
~% tar zxf vrtater-1.0.tar.gz
~% cd vrtater-1.0
~/vrtater-1.0% autoreconf --install
~/vrtater-1.0% ./configure
~/vrtater-1.0% make
~/vrtater-1.0% su
Password:
/home/me/vrtater-1.0# make install-html

This should install the given version of the source in /usr/local/bin/ and also
the vrtater manual in /usr/local/share/doc/ as html.

If not you may need to install the sources that support GL/gl.h and GL/glx.h
and make sure your kernel is built using the same version of these if you want
hardware acceleration to apply once vrtater is built.  You may also need to
install the sources supporting X11/X.h.

Aa well, latest versions of GNU Autoconf, GNU automake, and GNU gettext-runtime
may be required, although as of this writing they have not changed since 2006,
2008, and 2007 respectively.  This way only the hand edited files needed by
autoconf and automake needs be in the source repository.
