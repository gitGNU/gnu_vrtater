ChangeLog

2013-12-05  Jimmy Green  <green8@sdf-eu.org>

	vrtater pre-alpha began development on Savannah using git.
	A mechanism to sync git's branch master with this ChangeLog is
	sought.  Until a resolution for this arrives running git log will
	return the complete record of changes.  If any entries exist above
	this one it may mean there is a way to safely add entries here
	where these then remain sync'd with their respective commits vs.
	branch master in the git repo.
