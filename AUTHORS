If vrtater GNU free software is accepted to be part of the GNU Project, it will
become GNU vrtater.  Please be advised then that in this contingency, all
copyright for vrtater will be transfered to the FSF.

For now, add a copyright line of same form used currently to the file you are
editing where more than 15 lines or so are added, and your name plus the relevent
files added to in this file.  If you become the maintainer responsible for
session.c or dialog.c, thus providing the essential functionality for those parts
of the program, please place your copyright notice first in the list for given
file.  This may also be advised for other files if you become the main contributor
to given file.  If desired you may opt not to place a copyright notice, and then
by default be under one of the other copyright holders for files added to through
the references in this file.

If as a maintainer you add new files, please copyright them and add appropriate
further disclaimers as per <http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html> or the
same as files already maintained.  New files should also be recorded in this file.
Maintainers may need to check through maintain.html, standards.html, and the other
doc's at <http://www.gnu.org/prep/>, to insure that vrtater supports GNU standards.
