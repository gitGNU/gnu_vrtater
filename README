vrtater README
Copyright (C) 2012 J. A. Green <green8@sdf-eu.org>
license: GNU GPL v3, see COPYING, otherwise see vrtater.c

Status
Pre-alpha.  Seeking co-maintainers, patches, ip network code and hashing.
Currently offering vrtater to the GNU Project.  This pre-empts earlier plans to
wait for an alpha test version.

Introduction
Many of the features missing from the present source and thus in need of
development have been outlined in the source.  To set up, see INSTALL.
When installing you may also build the vrtater manual for more perspective.
You should see a demo of vobspace when vrtater is run and some term output.
For the interim, enabling DIAG_INTERFACE in progscope.h should produce some
ugly printf usage for movement/position feedback.(j to exit).
