Status
pre-alpha.  Seeking co-maintainers, patches.

Introduction
Many of the features missing from the present source and thus in need of
development have been outlined in the source.  If you can compile glx programs
with gcc already, there is a good chance vrtater will compile using make with
the j target.  You should see a demo of vobspace when vrtater is run and some
term output.  Enabling DIAG_INTERFACE in progscope.h should produce some ugly
term output(for now) for movement/position feedback.(j to exit).

wait for an alpha test version.
