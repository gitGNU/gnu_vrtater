/* Given selection in selectf_a, present dialog for partial referenced.  Caller
   generator.c sends any newly arrived hmaps with dialog, and any ones with
   locally modified dialog, as a series of sets per partial per call.  note:
   Needs support for any dialog features enabled for one whom runs vrtater
   locally, perhaps escaped in the dialog itself.  Also support for delimiter
   in hmaps arriving with VRT_MASK_KEYMAP set.  These will have dynamic dialog
   representing chat like or text bubble like input from vrtater peer nodes.
   These may contain a [tab]===comma,seperated,list\n delimiter that may contain
   tokens added by dialog*.c calls on other nodes.  As long as these tokens
   effect only hmaps and the token related calls in render*.c, and since the
   dialog is scanned for an allowed (see generator.c) subset of characters,
   it may be safe to use some calls listed in transform.c, like setting/syncing
   of dialog based groups using join_group.  Perhaps dialog specific calls like
   passwords for groups could be implemented using library /w ascii armor.  This
   delimiter also applies for dialog without VRT_MASK_TRUNK where the rendering
   code is concerned.  In either case, any hmap with this delimiter should
   retain VRT_MASK_DIALOG_MODS if there are any unused but local renderer
   supported tokens therein.  Code in render*.c uses these for example to
   determine how an hmap would ideally appear on the local node.  For the
   rendering code's purpose it would be handy to keep any delimiter strings at
   the top of dialog, perhaps also concatenating any multiple such strings
   minus used tokens and their data.  Supported tokens may also be added herein
   to interface the rendering code.  Minimal use vs. time for this feature is
   recommended.  The renderer may already be toggling occasional changes like
   atmosphere, etc, and may have an override for them specified as a
   configuration token (see: render*.c for more). */
